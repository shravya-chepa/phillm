    "question": "What would an Absurdist say about the search for truth?",
    "answer": "To put it simply, absurdism would argue that the search for truth is futile\u2014it's an impossible task because truth itself is impossible. The absurdist sees truth as a contradiction\u2014a desire to believe in something that can\u2019t exist.

The absurdity lies in the contradiction between the desire to believe and the impossibility of belief itself."

    "question": "Why do some philosophers reject objective reality?",
    "answer": "To put it simply, to reject objective reality means to reject the notion that there is an external world independent of human perception. According to many philosophers, this idea stems from a misunderstanding of how the mind works. The mind perceives the external world through its internal states, and these internal states are created by the mind itself. Therefore, there is no external, objective reality that exists apart from the mind. This perspective emphasizes how reality is constructed by the mind and not something to be discovered or understood."
