    "# Fine-Tuning an LLM for Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "By: Shravya Chepa\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Fine-tune a model to write philosophical queries and receive responses focusing on various schools of thought like: Stoicism, Nihilism, Rationalism, Existentialism, Utilitarianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Hedonism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Installs*\n",
    "The following modules need to be installed:\n",
    "```pip install bitsandbytes 'accelerate>=0.26.0' peft datasets torch```\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Process*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Preparation and Formatting: \n",
    "Gather texts from Stoicism, Hinduism, Taoism, and other schools of philosophy that are in the public domain. Make sure the books are public domain and free to use. The following books were used for this purpose:\n",
    "- [Letters from a Stoic by Seneca (Stoicism)](https://archive.org/details/letters-from-a-stoic-1)\n",
    "- [Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche (Nihilism)](https://archive.org/details/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft)\n",
    "- [Ethics by Spinoza (Rationalism)](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.263056)\n",
    "- [Fear and Trembling and The Sickness Unto Death by Søren Kierkegaard (Existentialism)](https://archive.org/details/fear-and-trembling-and-the-sickness-unto-death)\n",
    "- [Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill (Utilitarianism)](https://archive.org/details/utilitarianism00millrich)\n",
    "- [The Sacred Books of the East edited by Max Muller (Buddhism)](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2017)\n",
    "- [The Song Celestial by Sir Edwin Arnold (Hinduism)](https://archive.org/details/FoZf_the-song-celestial-bhagavad-gita-by-sir-edwin-arnold-jaico-publishing-house)\n",
    "- [Tao Te Ching by Laozi (Taoism)](https://archive.org/details/laozi_tao-te-ching)\n",
    "- [On the Nature of Things by Lucretius (Hedonism)](https://archive.org/details/lucretiusonnatu00lucr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert text into prompts and responses format. Use a semi-automated approach to generate these pairs. Use GPT o4 to generate these pairs from the books. Then structure the dataset in a consistent instruction-response format. Each data point is a JSON object with \"instruction\" field, an \"input\" field, and an \"output\" field. Since we need simple Q&A, the \"input\" is an empty string and \"output\" is the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"instruction\": \"What Stoic advice is given for dealing with life’s hardships such as poverty and death?\",\n",
    "    \"input\": \"\",\n",
    "    \"output\": \"Stoicism advises that each day, one should reflect on a single, meaningful idea that strengthens the mind against hardship. By regularly contemplating themes like poverty and mortality, one builds resilience and learns to face such conditions with calm acceptance.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the dataset in the data folder. There are two datasets that I experimented with: main_data.json (1035 objects) and expanded_data.json (2129 objects). These only differ in the number of examples I used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Selection (Choosing a Base LLM):\n",
    "I chose Phi-2 model because it is known for its strong performance despite its small-scale size. This model is then fine-tuned using LoRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Fine-Tuning Methodology:\n",
    "Utilize supervised instruction tuning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA tunes only a small percentage of the model's weights by inserting low-rank adapters, instead of updating all the billions of parameters. Can also combine LoRA with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA). The modules transformers, peft and bitsandbytes are used for this purpose. \n",
    "- Environment setup.\n",
    "- Load the base model and tokenizer with 4-bit precision loading enabled.\n",
    "- Prepare LoRA adapters (prepare_model_for_kbit_training).\n",
    "- Prepare the data for training. Tokenize the prompts and responses for the model. Format the instruction-response pairs so that only the response tokens contribute to the loss, by masking the prompt tokens during training (InstructionResponseCollator class defined).\n",
    "Alpaca format style looks like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Instruction: [instruction text]\n",
    "### Response: [response text]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Set the training hyperparameters and run the training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use the Fine-Tuned Model\n",
    "Once the training is complete, the model's LoRA adapter weights are saved within a folder. These weights can be loaded on top of the base model using PEFT library. I have three folders containing weights of three different models.\n",
    "- philosophy_model0: This contains the weights of the training when I did not specify EOS (End of Sequence) token to every response during training so the model did not learn when to end the response. So I fixed that for subsequent training and tests.\n",
    "- philosophy_model: This contains the weights of the training with the original dataset of 1035 entries. I found this model to be very overfit and wanted to improve performance against new unseen queries.\n",
    "- philosophy_model2: This contains the weights after training on an expanded dataset with a 1000 more question-answer pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Test Models with Prompts\n",
    "Test the base model, model1 (1035 entries) and model2 (2129 entries) with new random questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Visualize Training Loss Curve\n",
    "Read the training log from trainer_state.json and extract loss at each logging step. Then plot a line chart showing how the training loss decreases over time, visualizing the model's convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluate the model's answers. For this purpose, since the answers are open-ended, use GPT o3 to evaluate correctness, coherence and alignment to the specific philosophy of the responses.\n",
    "Create new set of questions and compare the results from base model and the fine-tuned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Hugging Face Upload and Demo Application\n",
    "Upload the model weights to Hugging Face and create a sample application to interact with the LLM model:\n",
    "[https://huggingface.co/spaces/shravya-chepa/phi2-philosophy](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shravya-chepa/phi2-philosophy)\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Hardware Used*\n",
    "The experiments were conducted on an **NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe GPU** with **CUDA 12.4** and **driver version 550.127.05**. MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) mode was **enabled**, with one instance active during testing.\n",

      "\n",
      "❓ What is the meaning of suffering in Buddhism?\n",
      "🧠 To put it simply, suffering in Buddhism is not merely physical pain but also emotional and mental anguish caused by attachment, ignorance, and craving. It arises from clinging to the self and the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ How does Stoicism define freedom?\n",
      "🧠 Stoicism defines freedom as the ability to live in accordance with reason, virtue, and nature without being controlled by external circumstances. A truly free person is not at the mercy of fate, fortune, or the actions of others—they are guided by their own moral compass and rational judgment. This is emphasized in many parts of the tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ What would an Absurdist say about the search for truth?\n",
      "🧠 To put it simply, absurdism would argue that the search for truth is futile—it's an impossible task because truth itself is impossible. The absurdist sees truth as a contradiction—a desire to believe in something that can’t exist. Since belief and truth are inseparable, trying to understand truth leads to paradoxes and despair. The absurdity lies in the contradiction between the desire to believe and the impossibility of belief itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ How can Taoism guide someone dealing with grief?\n",
      "🧠 To put it simply, taoism advises patience and surrender when facing grief. Like a tree that endures storms by bending, the wise person learns to endure suffering by yielding to fate. The Tao teaches that sorrow is part of life and resisting it only leads to more pain. True healing comes from accepting one’s fate and living in harmony with the natural flow of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ What does nihilism say about morality?\n",
      "🧠 Nihilism argues that morality, as a system of rules and beliefs, is not based on universal truths but on human convenience and social organization. It is a cultural construct that changes over time and often reflects the interests of the dominant group. Morality is not a divine truth, but a human invention that serves to regulate and control human behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ According to Stoicism, how should we face death?\n",
      "🧠 To put it simply, stoicism teaches that we should not fear death—it is simply the return to nature. We should not cling to life or be afraid of dying. Instead, we should prepare for death with reason and dignity, focusing on what we can control and leaving the rest to the will of the divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ Why do some philosophers reject objective reality?\n",
      "🧠 To put it simply, to reject objective reality means to reject the notion that there is an external world independent of human perception. According to many philosophers, this idea stems from a misunderstanding of how the mind works. The mind perceives the external world through its internal states, and these internal states are created by the mind itself. Therefore, there is no external, objective reality that exists apart from the mind. This perspective emphasizes how reality is constructed by the mind and not something to be discovered or understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ What is the Taoist approach to ambition and success?\n",
      "🧠 To put it simply, taoism discourages excessive ambition or pride in success, emphasizing instead a humble and harmonious relationship with life. True success is measured not by wealth or fame, but by inner peace, contentment, and a deep connection to the Tao.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ How does rationalism view emotional decision making?\n",
      "🧠 Rationalism argues that emotions are not the basis of decision making but rather a reaction to a decision already made. The mind chooses the action and then feels the emotion as a consequence. This means that emotional responses do not precede decisions, but follow them.\n",
      "\n",
      "❓ What is the significance of the Bodhisattva ideal in Mahayana Buddhism?\n",
      "🧠 The Bodhisattva ideal represents a transformative aspiration in Mahayana Buddhism. A Bodhisattva is a compassionate being who attains enlightenment not for personal liberation but to help others attain it as well. Their commitment to relieving suffering and guiding others toward liberation embodies the central ethic of the tradition.\n"

       "      <td>The Bodhisattva ideal symbolizes a committed path toward ending suffering for all beings. A bodhisattva is someone who has attained enlightenment but remains in the world to assist others in their spiritual journey. This practice aligns the individual's liberation with the liberation of all, embodying compassion and selflessness at the highest level of Buddhist ethics. This is emphasized in many parts of the tradition.</td>\n",

    "Microsoft Phi 2 model was fine-tuned on around 2k philosophy Q&A pairs using 4‑bit LoRA, aiming to surpass the base model’s answers across nine schools of thought. Blind GPT‑4 scoring on relevance, clarity, and philosophical depth showed the adapter trailing the base model (8.6 overall), with gains only on questions that closely mirrored training data and regressions on conceptually dense or under‑represented topics. The shortfall stems from classic overfitting because of tiny, imbalanced corpus and no validation split causing the adapter to memorise stylistic patterns. The future work must expand the dataset, introduce early‑stopping, and adopt preference‑based refinement to achieve measurable improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data scarcity & quality: 2129 prompts are insufficient for nine traditions; some labels contain over simplifications.\n",
    "- Single automatic judge: GPT‑4 rubric is useful but not a substitute for expert human philosophers.\n",
    "- UI quirks: The Gradio Space occasionally times out (> 30 s) when the A100 is busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "- Curate and expand the corpus to ≥ 10 k high‑fidelity Q&A pairs (or use synthetic self‑instruct plus human filtering).\n",
    "- Validation split + early stopping to arrest over‑fitting.\n",
    "- Lower learning rate (5 e‑5) and/or larger LoRA rank; experiment with adding k_proj/o_proj targets.\n",
    "- Try DPO/RLHF with preference data for depth & style."
